# Caesar Cipher Encryption:

A simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique.

# Overview:

This project implements a basic Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project includes functionality to both encode and decode messages using this technique.

# Files:

main.py: Contains the core functionality for the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption.

art.py: Contains ASCII art used to display the logo.

# Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ZayanMalick/Caesar_Cipher_Encryption.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Caesar_Cipher_Encryption

3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from python.org.

# Usage:

1. Run the main script:
        python main.py

2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
        Type 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message.

        Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.

        Enter the shift number (how many positions each letter should be shifted).

        The result will be displayed along with the option to run the program again or exit.

# Notes:

The program wraps around the alphabet, so shifting past 'z' returns to 'a'.

The ASCII art logo displayed is defined in art.py.
